  abstract = {A domain specific language (DSL) allows one to develop software for a particular application domain quickly and effectively, yielding programs that are easy to understand, reason about, and maintain. On the other hand, there may be a significant overhead in creating the infrastructure needed to support a DSL. To solve this problem, a methodology is described for building domain specific embedded languages (DSELs), in which a DSL is designed within an existing, higher-order and typed, programming language such as Haskell or ML. In addition, techniques are described for building modular interpreters and tools for DSELs. The resulting methodology facilitates reuse of syntax semantics, implementation code, software tools, as well as look-and-feel},

  abstract = {A domain-specific language DSL provides a notation tailored towards an application domain. The closer the language is to their target domain, the more useful the language is for developers. But this increment in the level of specificity raises the issue of duplication of concepts among different languages, and leads to the definition of a family of languages. Despite the advance in tool support for defining the abstract and concrete syntaxes of DSLs, developing a family of DSLs still requires a significant amount of duplicated effort. In this work we present an infrastructure for implementing families of textual DSLs. We introduce a technique based on XText that reduces the effort required to create editors and interpreters by enabling the modularization of the common features and the smooth specification of variability between the DSLs.},

  abstractNote={The design and implementation of complex software systems inherently spans multiple levels of abstractions. The concepts of each level of abstractions and their interplay are represented by formal languages that are either implicitly known or explicitly defined. Achieving high productivity in software development and maintenance is thus strongly connected with ruling the complexity of multi-level language design and evolution. This paper explains the necessity for automating multi-level language evolution, discusses its challenges and proposes concepts as well as a prototypical tool that support the incremental co-evolution of a staged language and program generation architecture. This approach reduces the cost of language maintenance and paves the ground for an incremental and bottom-up oriented way of developing domain specific languages.},

  abstractNote={The development of domain-specific languages (DSLs) is considered by many authors as a hard task. To simplify the design of DSLs we describe a design pattern based on the combinators technique, which can also provide guidelines for previous domain analysis phase because it is based on equational reasoning over the domain knowledge. Combinators is a common technique from functional programming to write programs. It was used many times to implement domain-specific embedded languages (DSELs) but that implementation approach is not the only one. In this paper we present the pattern together with the underlying and basic ideas behind it. We also show benefits of using it and illustrate the use of this pattern with some examples.},

  DOI={10.1145/1449913.1449935},
  abstractNote={The influential pure embedding methodology of embedding domain-specific languages (DSLs) as libraries into a general-purpose host language forces the DSL designer to commit to a single semantics. This precludes the subsequent addition of compilation, optimization or domain-specific analyses. We propose polymorphic embedding of DSLs, where many different interpretations of a DSL can be provided as reusable components, and show how polymorphic embedding can be realized in the programming language Scala. With polymorphic embedding, the static type-safety, modularity, composability and rapid prototyping of pure embedding are reconciled with the flexibility attainable by external toolchains.},
