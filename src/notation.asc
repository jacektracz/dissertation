== Notation

Figures in this thesis depicting a software architecture, a specific part of an architecture, or a dynamic structure have been created using the Fundamental Modeling Concepts (FMC) _block diagram_ and _petri net_ notation cite:Keller2002[]. FMC can be used to describe and communicate complex software architectures with a limited set of symbols and rules.

_FMC block diagrams_ describe the structure and the components of a system. The following list summarises the main elements (see also Figure&nbsp;<<img-fmc-notation>>):

* _Stickmen:_ Active human actors
* _Rectangles (boxes with straight edges):_ Active components that serve a well-defined purpose--e.g. controllers and web services
* _Boxes with round edges:_ Passive systems, components channels or storage--e.g. files, databases, and communication channels
* _Arrows and connecting lines:_ Access type--read or write (arrows) or both (lines)
* _Circles:_ Communication channels with a directed request direction

_FMC petri nets_ are used to depict the dynamic structures of a system, which means the behaviour of the system and the actions performed by the components. The main elements are (see also Figure <<img-fmc-notation2>>):

* _Transitions:_ An operation, an event or an activity
* _Places_: A control state or a condition
* _Arrows_: Connect places and transitions

There are a few other elements in FMC. For a complete overview including examples we refer to the official notation reference cite:Apfelbacher2003[].
